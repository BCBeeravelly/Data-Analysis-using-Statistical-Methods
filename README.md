## Title:  Data Analysis on General Health using Statistical Methods
## Description:
This project aims to conduct an in-depth data analysis focusing on the target variable (`HeartDisease`) and various other features. The primary objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the relevance and dependence of each feature on the target variable. Through the application of statistical methods, we delve into the intricacies of the dataset to extract meaningful insights into general health metrics.

In the initial phase of our project, we embark on a comprehensive exploration of the dataset. Utilizing summary statistics and visualizations like histograms, box plots, and bar charts, we aim to gain insights into the distribution and characteristics of our variables. Further, we scrutinize the normality of continuous variables through Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plots. Subsequent to visualization, our data preprocessing involves the removal of redundant features and the elimination of specific categories within features to ensure unbiased statistical tests. Additionally, we curate a representative sample of 1000 rows for focused analysis. Correlation analysis is then employed to unveil relationships between variables.

Transitioning into Inferential Statistics, we initiate with the Chi-square test of independence to assess the independence of two categorical variables. Following this, the Kruskal-Wallis test is executed to evaluate if the categories within each variable share the same distribution. Lastly, the Mann-Whitney U test is applied to examine the distributions of continuous variables concerning the occurrences of heart disease. These inferential tests provide valuable insights into the interplay and associations within the dataset.

Concluding the project, we delve into the development of multiple logistic regression models. Our approach involves building distinct models with varied combinations of variables, assessing their performance, and selecting the optimal model based on the R-squared value. This final phase encapsulates the culmination of our data analysis journey, providing a robust foundation for drawing informed conclusions and making predictions related to heart disease.
